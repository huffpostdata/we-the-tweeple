// Makes the site follow these general rules:
//
// * <nav> at the top, followed by <article> and <footer>. They're all in a
//   flexbox, so the footer is at the bottom no matter the size of the page.
// * max width is 960px, but it's only applied to <article> children. That lets
//   us publish full-width images without fiddling with margins. (Give them the
//   class "full-width" to achieve that.)
// * Sets $max-mobile-width and $min-desktop-width, and makes ".only-desktop"
//   and ".only-mobile" classes hide things.
// * Creates the page-width() mixin, to set things to 960px
